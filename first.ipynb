       "\"The invention of the light bulb is often attributed to **Thomas Edison**, but it's more accurate to say he **perfected and commercialized** it.\\n\\nHere's a more nuanced breakdown:\\n\\n*   **Early Inventors:** Many inventors before Edison had created various forms of electric lights. Some notable figures include:\\n\\n    *   **Humphry Davy:** Created the first electric light in 1802, an arc lamp.\\n    *   **Warren de la Rue:** Developed an efficient enclosed light bulb in 1840, but it was too expensive to commercialize.\\n    *   **Joseph Swan:** Independently developed a working light bulb around the same time as Edison.\\n\\n*   **Edison's Contribution:** Edison's key contributions were:\\n\\n    *   **A practical, long-lasting design:** He experimented with different filaments and eventually found that carbonized bamboo worked well.\\n    *   **A complete electrical system:** He didn't just invent the bulb; he also developed the generators, wiring, and other components needed to make electric lighting practical for homes and businesses.\\n    *   **Commercialization:** He established manufacturing and distribution systems to make electric lighting widely available.\\n\\n**In summary:** While Edison is most famous for the light bulb, he built upon the work of earlier inventors and is best known for creating a practical, affordable, and commercially viable electric lighting system.\""
